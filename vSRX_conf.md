# Creating a secure connection with a remote Juniper vSRX peer
{: #creating-a-secure-connection-with-a-remote-juniper-vsrx-peer}

This document is based on Juniper vSRX, JUNOS Software Release [15.1X49-D123.3].

The example steps that follow skip the prerequisite steps of using {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} API or CLI to create Virtual Private Clouds. For more information, see [Getting Started](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started-with-ibm-cloud-virtual-private-cloud-infrastructure) and [VPC setup with APIs](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-rest-apis).

## Example steps
The topology for connecting to the remote Juniper vSRX peer is similar to [creating a VPN connection between two VPCs](/docs/infrastructure/vpc-network?topic=vpc-network---beta-using-vpn-with-your-vpc). However, one side of the connection is replaced by the Juniper vSRX unit.

### To create a secure connection with a remote Juniper vSRX peer

When a VPN peer receives a connection request from a remote VPN peer, it uses IPsec Phase 1 parameters to establish a secure connection and authenticate that VPN peer. Then, if the security policy permits the connection, the Juniper vSRX unit establishes the tunnel using IPsec Phase 2 parameters and applies the IPsec security policy. Key management, authentication, and security services are negotiated dynamically through the IKE protocol.

**To support these functions, the following general configuration steps must be performed by the Juniper vSRX unit:**

* Define the Phase 1 parameters that the Juniper vSRX requires to authenticate the remote peer and establish a secure connection.

* Define the Phase 2 parameters that the Juniper vSRX requires to create a VPN tunnel with the remote peer.
To connect to the IBM Cloud VPC's VPN capability, we recommend the following configuration:

1. Choose `IKEv1` in phase 1;
2. Setup policy mode, not route mode;
3. Enable `DH-group 2` in the Phase 1 proposal
4. Set `lifetime = 36000` in the Phase 1 proposal
5. Enable PFS in the Phase 2 proposal
6. Set `lifetime = 10800` in the Phase 2 proposal
7. Input your peer's and subnet's information in the Phase 2 proposal
8. Allow UDP 500 traffic on external interface.

#### Known limitations

* Juniper vSRX supports IKEv2 in _route mode_ only. Therefore, if you set up IKEv2 in policy mode, you'll see the error `IKEv2 requires bind-interface configuration as only route-based is supported`. However, IBM Cloud VPC VPNaaS currently supports _policy mode_ only, so you must set up IKEv1 in Phase 1 to use the Juniper vSRX.

* By default, IBM Cloud VPC VPNaaS disables PFS in Phase 2, and vSRX requires PFS to be _enabled_ in Phase 2. For this reason, you must create a new IPsec policy to replace the default policy on the VPC VPNaaS side.

### Log in to the Juniper vSRX to configure it using SSH

#### Here's an example of how to set up security:

#### Here's an example of how to set up the firewall:

```
admin@Juniper-vSRX# show firewall filter PROTECT-IN term VPN_IKE
from {
    destination-address {
        169.61.195.195/32;
        10.93.160.12/32;
    }
    protocol udp;
    port 500;
}
then accept;

[edit]
```

After the configuration file has finished executing, you may check the connection status from the CLI, with the following command:

```
 run show security ipsec security-associations
```
### To create a secure connection with the local IBM Cloud VPC

To create a secure connection, you'll create the VPN connection within your VPC, which is similar to the 2 VPC example.

**Remember, you must enable PFS in Phase 2, so you must create a new IPsec policy before you create a connection.**

![vpc-vpn-vsrx-ipsec](./images/vpc-vpn-vsrx-ipsec.png)

Create a VPN gateway on your VPC subnet, along with a VPN connection between the VPC and the Juniper vSRX, setting `local_cidrs` to the subnet value on the VPC, and `peer_cidrs` to the subnet value on the Juniper vSRX.

The gateway status appears as `pending` while the VPN gateway is being created, and the status becomes `available` once creation is complete. Creation may take some time.

### Check the status for a secure connection

You can check the status of your connection through the IBM Cloud console. Also, you could try to do a `ping` from site to site using the VSIs.
