# (Beta) Using Load Balancers in IBM Cloud VPC
{: #--beta-using-load-balancers-in-ibm-cloud-vpc}

The load balancer service distributes traffic among multiple server instances within the same region for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC.

**This service is now in Beta release version. Resources used during the Beta period will not be available after the close of Beta, and no support will be available. Please direct comments and questions to your IBM Cloud sales representative.**

## Public load balancer
{: #public-load-balancer}

Your load balancer service instance is assigned a publicly-accessible, fully qualified domain name (FQDN), which you must use for access to your applications that are hosted behind the load balancer service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC. This domain name may be registered with one or more public IP addresses.

Over time, these public IP addresses and the number of public IP addresses may change based on maintenance and scaling activities, which are transparent to customers. The back-end server instances (VSIs) hosting your application must run in the same region, and under the same VPC.

## Front-end listeners and back-end pools
You may define up to 10 front-end listeners (application ports) and map them to respective back-end pools on the back-end application servers. The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) assigned to your load balancer service instance and the front-end listener ports are exposed to the public internet. Incoming user requests are received on these ports.

The supported front-end listener protocols are:
* HTTP
* HTTPS
* TCP

The supported back-end pool protocols are:
* HTTP
* TCP

Incoming HTTPS traffic is terminated at the load balancer to allow for plain-text HTTP communication with the back-end server.

You may attach up to 50 server instances to a back-end pool. Each attached server instance must have a port configured. The port may or may not be the same as front-end listener port.

The port range of 56500 to 56520 is reserved for management purposes; these ports cannot be used as front-end listener ports.
{: note}

## Load balancing methods
{: #load-balancing-methods}

The following three load balancing methods are available for distributing traffic among back-end application servers:

* **Round-robin:** Round-robin is the default load balancing method. With this method, the load balancer forwards
incoming client connections in round-robin fashion to the back-end servers. As a result, all back-end servers receive
roughly an equal number of client connections.

* **Weighted Round-robin:** With this method, the load balancer forwards incoming client connections to the back-end
servers in proportion to the weight assigned to these servers. Each server is assigned a default weight of 50,
which may be customized to any value between 0 and 100.

As an example, if three application servers A, B and C, have weights customized to 60, 60, and 30 respectively, then servers A and B receive an equal number of connections, while server C receives half that number of connections.

* **Least connections:** With this method, the server instance serving the least number of connections at a given time receives the next client connection.

**Additional characteristics of these methods:**

* Re-setting a server weight to '0' means no new connections are forwarded to that server, but any existing traffic will continue to flow as long as it is active. Using a weight of '0' can help bring down a server gracefully and remove it from service rotation.
* The server weight values are applicable only with the weighted round-robin method. They are ignored with round-robin and least connections load balancing methods.

## Health Checks
{: #health-checks}

Health check definitions are mandatory for back-end pools.

The load balancer conducts periodic health checks to monitor the health of the back-end ports, and it forwards client traffic to them accordingly. If a given back-end server port is found to be unhealthy, no new connections are forwarded to it. The load balancer continues to monitor health of unhealthy ports, and it resumes their use if they become healthy again, which means that they successfully pass two consecutive health check attempts.

The health checks for HTTP and TCP ports are conducted as follows:

* **HTTP:** An `HTTP GET` request against a pre-specified URL is sent to the back-end server port. The server port is marked healthy upon receiving a `200 OK` response. The default `GET` health path is "/" via the UI, and it can be customized.

* **TCP:** The Load Balancer attempts to open a TCP connection with the back-end server on a specified TCP port. The server port is marked healthy if the connection attempt is successful, and the connection is closed.

The default health check interval is 5 seconds, the default timeout against a health check request is 2 seconds, and the default number of retrial attempts is 2.
{: note}

## SSL offloading and required authorizations

For all incoming HTTPS connections, the load balancer service terminates the SSL connection and establishes a plain-text HTTP communication with the back-end server instance. With this technique, CPU-intensive SSL handshakes and encryption or decryption tasks are shifted away from the back-end server instances, thereby allowing them to use all their CPU cycles for processing application traffic.

An SSL certificate is required for the load balancer to perform SSL offloading tasks. You may manage the SSL certificates through [IBM Certificate Manager ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/certificate-manager?topic=certificate-manager-gettingstarted){: new_window}.

If you need load balancer access to the SSL certificate in your certificate manager instance, create an authorization that gives the load balancer service instance access to the certificate manager instance that contains the SSL certificate. You may manage such an authorization through [Identity and Access Authorizations ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/iam/#/authorizations){: new_window}. Please make sure to choose **Infrastructure Service** as the source service, **Load Balancer for VPC** as the resource type, **Certificate Manager** as the target service, and assign the **Writer** service access role. To create a load balancer, you must grant **All resource instances** authorization for the source resource instance. The target service instance may be **All instances**, or it may be or your specific certificate manager resource instance.

If the required authorization is removed, errors may occur for your load balancer.
{: note}

## Identity and access management (IAM)

You can configure access policies for a **Load Balancer for VPC** instance. To manage your user access policies, please visit [Identity and Access Authorizations ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/iam/#/authorizations){: new_window}.

### Configuring resource group access policies for users

To create a load balancer, you'll need access to a resource group. The user who is creating a load balancer must have proper access to the resource group provided, or to the default resource group if none is provided.

1. Navigate to **Manage > Account > Users**. You'll see a list of the users with access to your IBM Cloud account.
2. Select the name of the user to whom you want to assign an access policy. If the user is not shown, click **Invite users** to add the user to your IBM Cloud account.
3. Select **Assign access**.
4. Select **Assign access within a resource group**.
5. From the **Resource group** drop-down list, select the desired resource group.
6. From the **Assign access to a resource group** drop-down list, select the desired access.
7. From the **Services** drop-down list, select the desired services.
9. Select **Assign** to assign the resource group access policy to the user.

### Configuring resource access policies for users

| Platform Access Role | Load Balancer Action |
|-------------|-----|
| Administrator | Create/View/Edit/Delete load balancer |
| Editor | Create/View/Edit/Delete load balancer |
| Viewer | View load balancer |

1. Navigate to **Manage > Account > Users**. You'll see list of the users with access to your IBM Cloud account.
2. Select the name of the user to whom you want to assign an access policy. If the user is not shown, click **Invite users** to add the user to your IBM Cloud account.
3. Select **Assign access**.
4. Select **Assign access to resources**.
5. From the **Services** drop-down list, select **Infrastructure Service**.
6. From the **Resource type** drop-down list, select **Load Balancer for VPC**.
7. From the **Load Balancer ID** drop-down list, select a Load Balancer instance ID, or use the default value, **All load balancers**.
8. Assign a platform access role to the user.
9. Select **Assign** to assign the access policy to the user.

## APIs available

To make API calls, you must use some form of REST client. For example, you can use the `curl` command to retrieve all existing load balancers:

```
curl -X GET $rias_endpoint/v1/load_balancers?version=2019-01-01 -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

The following section gives details about APIs you can use for load balancers in your VPC environment. For the full spec, see the [RIAS API reference](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/rias#retrieves-all-load-balancers).

| Description | API |
|-------------|-----|
| Creates and provisions a load balancer | POST /load_balancers |
| Retrieves all load balancers | GET /load_balancers |
| Retrieves a load balancer | GET /load_balancers/{id} |
| Deletes a load balancer | DELETE /load_balancers/{id} |
| Updates a load balancer | PATCH /load_balancers/{id} |
| Creates a listener | POST /load_balancers/{id}/listeners |
| Retrieves all listeners of the load balancer | GET /load_balancers/{id}/listeners |
| Retrieves a listener | GET /load_balancers/{id}/listeners/{listener_id} |
| Deletes a listener | DELETE /load_balancers/{id}/listeners/{listener_id} |
| Updates a listener | PATCH /load_balancers/{id}/listeners/{listener_id} |
| Creates a pool | POST /load_balancers/{id}/pools |
| Retrieves all pools of the load balancer | GET /load_balancers/{id}/pools |
| Retrieves a pool | GET /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id} |
| Deletes a pool | DELETE /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id} |
| Updates a pool | PATCH /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id} |
| Creates a member | POST /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id}/members |
| Retrieves all members of the pool | GET /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id}/members |
| Retrieves a member |GET /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id}/members/{member_id} |
| Deletes a member from the pool | DELETE /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id}/members/{member_id} |
| Updates a member | PATCH /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id}/members/{member_id} |
| Updates members of the pool | PUT /load_balancers/{id}/pools/{pool_id}/members |

## Load balancer example

In the following example, you'll use the API to create a load balancer in front of 2 VPC server instances (`192.168.100.5` and `192.168.100.6`) running a web application listening on port `80`. The load balancer has a front-end listener, which allows access to the web application securely by means of HTTPS. Then you can use the API to get details of the load balancer instance after it is created, and to delete the load balancer instance.

### Example steps

The example steps that follow skip the prerequisite steps of using the [IBM Cloud UI](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console), [CLI](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-cli) or [RIAS API](/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-rest-apis) to provision a VPC, subnet(s), and instances. 


The load balancer example steps can also be run using the [CLI](/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud?topic=infrastructure-service-cli-vpc-reference#vpc-reference).

## FAQs

This section contains answers to some frequently asked questions about the **Load Balancer for VPC** service.

### Can I use a different DNS name for my load balancer?

The auto-assigned DNS name for the load balancer is not customizable. However, you can add a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points your preferred DNS name to the auto-assigned load balancer DNS name. For example, your load balancer ID is `dd754295-e9e0-4c9d-bf6c-58fbc59e5727`, the auto-assigned load balancer DNS name is `dd754295-e9e0-4c9d-bf6c-58fbc59e5727.lb.appdomain.cloud`. Your preferred DNS name is `www.myapp.com`. You may add a CNAME record (through the DNS provider that you use to manage `myapp.com`) pointing `www.myapp.com` to the load balancer DNS name `dd754295-e9e0-4c9d-bf6c-58fbc59e5727.lb.appdomain.cloud`.

### What's the maximum number of front-end listeners I can define with my load balancer?

10.

### What's the maximum number of server instances I can attach to my back-end pool?

50.

### Can I create an internal-only, private load balancer that is accessible only to internal clients?  

No, not at this time.

### Is the load balancer horizontally scalable?  

No, not at this time.

### What should I do if I am using ACLs or security groups on the subnets that are used to deploy the load balancer?

You'll need to ensure that the proper ACL or security group rules are in place to allow incoming traffic for configured listener ports and management ports (ports from 56500 - 56520). Traffic between the load balancer and back-end instances also should be allowed.

### Why am I receiving an error message: `certificate instance not found`?

* The certificate instance CRN may be invalid.
* You may not have granted Service-to-Service Authorization. See the **SSL offloading** section of this document.

### Why am I receiving a `401 Unauthorized Error` code?

Check the following access policies for your user:
* Load balancer resource type access policy
* Resource group access policy

### Why is my load balancer in `maintenance_pending` state?

The load balancer will be in `maintenance_pending` state during various maintenance activities such as:
* Any rolling upgrade to address vulnerabilities and apply security patches
* Recovery activities

### Why do I need to choose multiple subnets during provisioning?

Load balancer appliances are deployed to the subnets you've selected. It is highly recommended to choose subnets from different zones for higher availability and redundancy.
