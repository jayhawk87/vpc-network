# Creating a secure connection with a remote Cisco ASAv peer
{: #creating-a-secure-connection-with-a-remote-cisco-asav-peer}

This document is based on Cisco ASAv, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.10(1).

The example steps that follow skip the prerequisite steps of using {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} API or CLI to create Virtual Private Clouds. For more information, see [Getting Started](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started-with-ibm-cloud-virtual-private-cloud-infrastructure) and [VPC setup with APIs](https://{DomainName}/docs/infrastructure/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-rest-apis).

## Example steps
The topology for connecting to the remote Cisco ASAv peer is similar to creating a VPN connection between two {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Clouds. However, one side is replaced by the Cisco ASAv unit.

### To create a secure connection with the remote Cisco ASAv peer

The first step in configuring your Cisco ASA for use with the IBM VPC VPN is to
ensure that the following prerequisite conditions have been set:

* Cisco ASAv is online and functional with a proper license
* A password for the Cisco ASAv is enabled
* There's at least one configured and verified functional internal interface
* There's at least one configured and verified functional external interface

When a Cisco ASAv unit receives a connection request from a remote VPN peer, it uses IPsec Phase 1 parameters to establish a secure connection and authenticate that VPN peer. Then, if the security policy permits the connection, the Cisco ASAv establishes the tunnel using IPsec Phase 1 parameters and applies the IPsec security policy. Key management, authentication, and security services are negotiated dynamically through the IKE protocol.

**To support these functions, the following general configuration steps must be performed by the Cisco ASAv unit:**

* Define the Phase 1 parameters that the Cisco ASAv unit requires to authenticate the remote peer and establish a secure connection.
* Define the Phase 2 parameters that the Cisco ASAv unit requires to create a VPN tunnel with the remote peer.

Create an Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version 2 proposal object. IKEv2 proposal objects
contain the parameters required for creating IKEv2 proposals when defining remote access and
site-to-site VPN policies. IKE is a key management protocol that facilitates the management of
IPsec-based communications. It is used to authenticate IPsec peers, negotiate and distribute
IPsec encryption keys, and automatically establish IPsec security associations (SAs). 

```
group-policy GroupPolicy_161.156.80.10 internal
group-policy GroupPolicy_161.156.80.10 attributes
 vpn-tunnel-protocol ikev1 ikev2 
tunnel-group 161.156.80.10 type ipsec-l2l
tunnel-group 161.156.80.10 general-attributes
 default-group-policy GroupPolicy_161.156.80.10
tunnel-group 161.156.80.10 ipsec-attributes
 ikev1 pre-shared-key <key value>
 ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-key <key value>
 ikev2 local-authentication pre-shared-key <key value>
```

Create an IKEv2 policy configuration for the IPsec connection. The IKEv2 policy block sets the
parameters for the IKE exchange. In this block, the following parameters are set:
* Encryption algorithm - set to AES-256 for this example
* Integrity algorithm - set to SHA256 for this example
* Diffie-Hellman group - IPsec uses the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to generate the initial
encryption key between the peers. In this example it is set to group 14
* Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) - IKEv2 requires a separate method used as the
algorithm to derive keying material and hashing operations required for the IKEv2 tunnel
encryption. This is referred to as the pseudo-random function and is set to SHA
* SA Lifetime - set the lifetime of the security associations (after which a reconnection will
occur). Set to 36,000 seconds.
* Operation type - keep this as the default value, bi-directional. (It's not explicit in the "show running" display.)

As shown in the following code example, this sample policy uses AES-256 to encrypt the secure channel. The SHA512
hash algorithm is used to validate the identity of the remote peer, and Diffie-Hellman group
14 is utilized for key generation. Group 14 uses 2048 bit encryption blocks. Finally, a
lifetime for the security association is set to 36,000 seconds.

```
crypto ikev2 policy 100
encryption aes-256
integrity sha-1
group 14
prf sha
lifetime seconds 36000
```

* Define the access list and crypto map for VPN:

```
access-list outside_cryptomap_1 extended permit ip object NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.236.0_24 object vpc 
crypto map outside_map 1 match address outside_cryptomap_1
crypto map outside_map 1 set peer 161.156.80.10 
crypto map outside_map 1 set ikev1 transform-set ESP-AES-128-SHA ESP-AES-128-MD5 ESP-AES-192-SHA ESP-AES-192-MD5 ESP-AES-256-SHA ESP-AES-256-MD5 ESP-3DES-SHA ESP-3DES-MD5 ESP-DES-SHA ESP-DES-MD5
crypto map outside_map 1 set ikev2 ipsec-proposal AES256 AES192 AES 3DES DES
crypto map outside_map interface outside
nat (any,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.236.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.236.0_24 destination static vpc vpc no-proxy-arp route-lookup
```

## To create a secure connection with the local IBM VPC

To create a secure connection, you'll create the VPN connection within your VPC, which is similar to the 2 VPC example.

* Create a VPN gateway on your VPC subnet  along with a VPN connection between the VPC and the Cisco ASAv, setting `local_cidrs` to the subnet value on the VPC, and `peer_cidrs` to the subnet value on the Cisco ASAv.

The gateway status appears as `pending` while the VPN gateway is being created, and the status becomes `available` once creation is complete. Creation may take some time.

### Check the status of the secure connection

You can check the status of your connection through the IBM Cloud console. Also, you could try to do a `ping` from site to site using the VSIs.
